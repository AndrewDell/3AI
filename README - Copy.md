# 3AI – Multi-Agent AI Automation
**Automate. Optimize. Scale.**

---

**Introduction / Overview**

**Project Description:**  
3AI is an innovative multi-agent AI automation system designed to streamline and enhance business processes. By leveraging Google’s Gemini 2.0 for AI-powered orchestration and employing containerized Python environments, 3AI enables modular AI agents to work collaboratively, reducing manual tasks, improving productivity, and delivering real-time insights.

**Objectives:**
- Utilize Google’s Gemini 2.0 to power AI and ML capabilities.
- Deploy containerized Python environments for consistent and reproducible setups.
- Enable flexible, modular AI agents that interact to automate complex workflows.

---

**Key Features**

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**  
  Seamlessly coordinate specialized AI agents that handle tasks such as sales, marketing, operations, and customer success, ensuring efficient process automation.

- **Integration with Google Gemini 2.0:**  
  Harness cutting-edge AI/ML capabilities for natural language understanding, predictive analytics, and dynamic task management.

- **Containerization:**  
  Use Docker to create isolated, reproducible environments that simplify deployment and scaling across different platforms.

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  A well-structured codebase that separates core functionality, individual agent logic, UI components, and configuration, making it easy to extend and maintain.

**Installation & Setup**

**Prerequisites**
- **Python:** Version 3.10 (64-bit) or later (compatible with TensorFlow).
- **Docker:** For containerized deployment.
- **Git:** For version control and contribution management.

**Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

**Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd 3AI
   ```

**Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
**Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
**Set Up Dockers:**
   ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
   ```
**Usage**

    docker-compose up
    python src/ui/dashboard.py
    pytest tests/
   ```

**Configuration Files**

- **General Settings:**  
  The `src/config/settings.yaml` file is where you adjust system parameters that control various aspects of the application. You can configure:
  - **API Keys:** Insert keys for external services (e.g., Google Gemini 2.0).
  - **Agent Behavior:** Set defaults for how agents interact, such as task scheduling intervals and retry attempts.
  - **Logging Levels:** Define the verbosity of logging (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to suit your development or production needs.

  **Example (`src/config/settings.yaml`):**
  ```yaml
  api:
    google_gemini_key: "AIzaSyDYTt1JxARqo1OP3i6Vj1VB64ulU_FRq-E"

  agent:
    default_timeout: 30  # Timeout in seconds for agent tasks
    retry_attempts: 3    # Number of times to retry failed tasks

  logging:
    level: INFO        # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
    file: logs/3ai.log  # Log file path
